                    <h3>Apo-Context: Apo-Boys</h3>
                    <p>I graduated from the Federal Government Boys' College, Abuja in Nigeria (city and country of
                        birth). Alumni and students call it Apo-Boiz. It's one of Nigeria's Unity Colleges, built for
                        merit and diversity. Translation: wake up early, obey the rules already in place, compete hard,
                        and don't get caught sneaking food, in other words, survive. That discipline-plus-competition
                        cocktail shaped how I approach both life and tech.</p>

                    <h3>Apo-Moments: My Graduation - Moments</h3>
                    <p>Gratitude. Excitement. Curiosity. Nostalgia. On July 24, 2016, I left FGBC with a mindset that
                        still keeps me set today: show up, do the work, lead when it counts, and learn faster and better
                        than yesterday. I believe in the Power Law of Practice. Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward
                        (1888): being in a setting that promoted unity and socialism, I could take my newly earned
                        traits to join the team that drives technology as a force of social harmony. Following
                        graduation I read Equality, Bellamy's sequel. I understood that the key was education in proper
                        beliefs and virtue. I found the blockchain community.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prefects, basketball, computer labs, basically my first systems labs.</li>
                        <li>Early sparks of computer systems: what if I became one of the leading innovators of a
                            technology utopia?</li>
                        <li>I heard the word Dev for the first time in a Discord space: like-minded developers coming
                            together to actualize dreams.</li>
                        <li>"It was delusional to ever think of computers when humans are out there and need doctors."
                            Doctors need computers, Dad.</li>

                    <h3>Apo-Foundations: Independence in Survival</h3>
                    <p>Boarding house equals bootcamp for independence. You either learned to think for yourself or
                        became
                        the joke of the week.</p>
                    <p>We were like rough stones in a quarry, colliding until something sharper came out. Lux ex labore,
                        light from labor. Pro Unitate, for unity, is the Latin motto of the Federal Government
                        colleges. Like a multi-linked list, we comprised different religions and ethnic backgrounds. To
                        make our country better, we learned to coexist within the four walls of an institution from a
                        young age. It worked for me.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brotherhood that tested loyalty and patience in equal measure, in every nook and cranny.
                        </li>
                        <li>Discipline carved through endless duties and drills.</li>
                        <li>Friendships that polished away doubt (and sometimes stole your provisions or junk food
                            supply).</li>
                        <li>Routine living was the order of the day.</li>
                        <li>Table-top beat jockeys for the rappers and musicians that entertained me. My BIOT MP3s.</li>

                    <h3>The Bridge: From High School to University</h3>
                    <p>Between secondary school and university, the "medical doctor or nothing" pressure hit. But I
                        chose my future, knowing computers were the next gods to rule Terra alongside humans. I wanted
                        in on that golden age not just as a consumer.</p>
                    <p>In October 2017, I enrolled in a pre-degree program in sciences at Michael Okpara University.
                        From there, I earned admission into Computer Science with Education, stacking a double degree
                        (B.Sc. + B.Ed.). That mindset of shaping my future was born in boarding school, many Nigerian
                        IT experts walked those halls before me. Spending months away from my parents cultivated a way
                        of thinking that embraced decisions and their outcomes. I learned I could and should show myself
                        the way and be prepared for any outcome.</p>

                    <h3>Uni-Arrival: Stepping into Higher Education</h3>
                    <p>I made it into university, but it wasn't the temple of knowledge as I'd imagined. The curriculum
                        felt shallow, more chalk dust than fundamentals. The system of education wasn't impressive.</p>
                    <p>By then, I had already taught myself HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript at age 15. So I knew I had to
                        expand my horizon beyond the lecture hall. I'd attend lectures while contrasting what I was
                        learning with PDFs from Harvard and other great institutions that publish materials online. I
                        was right: lectures felt redacted so the low-income lecturer could get home on time, not the
                        way to teach the future.</p>
                    <blockquote>I glued myself to PDFs and YouTube.</blockquote>

                    <h3>Teaching-Practice: Bridging Taught Theory and Real-World Impact</h3>
                    <p>Double honours meant double duty.</p>
                    <p>At Ibeku High School, I spent 6 months teaching:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>SS3 students (16–22): revisions from numbering systems to basics of programming and
                            internet security.</li>
                        <li>Younger students (10–18): computer basics, software, operating systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>During my last months, I trained staff at the National Root Crop Research Institute on RFID,
                        smart cards, and ID card makers, and did a quick flex with Pandas/Numpy automations as they
                        wanted to see my appraised project. As a carry-over student, I had an extra year (issues from
                        choosing CS). My web project was an EDA using Python (we were told to use any language, we were
                        never taught OOP). It argued for the importance of Computer Studies in Nigerian institutions and
                        how our curriculum compared poorly to others. People said my slides felt like a boardroom deck,
                        because I did the extra learning required.</p>
                    <p>Teaching wasn't just duty; it clarified my learning, showed my blind spots, and sharpened my
                        confidence.</p>

                    <h3>Uni-Grind: The Real Learning Journey</h3>
                    <p>Algorithms, data structures, operating systems, databases, these stuck. The prerequisites? I
                        passed most exams without retaining much.</p>
                    <p>So I hacked my education:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skipped SED407 and some irrelevant classes to practise Python in my hostel.</li>
                        <li>Spent time in Discord and X spaces, learning blockchain through materials and interaction
                            with devs.</li>
                        <li>By final year (extra year), I was learning AI and machine learning.</li>
                        <li>Learned to draw and generate NFTs; designed my first SVG NFT for a community in my 5th year
                            (I spent 6 years).</li>
                        <li>Realized my Iter was too big for one country; it needed to spark outside Africa. Resources
                            were too limited.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That's when I started planning the move.</p>

                        <li>I mastered the art of selling and advertising. Some days, when I felt pumped, I didn't drive
                            — I'd literally hawk.</li>
                        <li>The path I was on, the business I managed, and my background made me seem shameless to some.
